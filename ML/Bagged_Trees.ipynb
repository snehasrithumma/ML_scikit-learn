    "Each machine learning algorithm has strengths and weaknesses. A weakness of decision trees is that they are prone to overfitting on the training set. A way to mitigate this problem is to constrain how large a tree can grow. Bagged trees try to overcome this weakness by using bootstrapped data to grow multiple deep decision trees. The idea is that many trees protect each other from individual weaknesses.\n",
